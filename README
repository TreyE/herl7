===== HErl7 =====
(C) 2008-2009 Lewis R. Evans IV

A simple HL7 suite for Erlang.

It's important to note that the Erlang part of this uses Erlware.org's Sinan,
so if you want to be able to build/install it, you will need Faxien and Sinan
installed.

=== What does this software do? ===

This software provides a simple HL7 parser/serializer for erlang.
